##Presentation.

A light console application for Twitter that I've been wanting to create for quite some time. Might not be suitable for long term use, but eh. Let's be honest, this is mainly for muh personal branling and nerd-ish stuff.
Tho I'm quite motivated into making a full UI material-ish client, but I'm still trying to figure out the shit ass limited API Twitter made for third party apps.

##Previews

Everything shown in the "asc help" command works.
